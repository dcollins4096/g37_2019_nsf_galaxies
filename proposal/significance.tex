\section{Significance of Proposed Work}
\vspace{-3mm}

Magnetic fields are essential components of galactic structure, but
the nature of their growth and morphology is elusive to understand
from a theoretical and numerical standpoint.  The challenge in doing
so lies in the difficulty of devising a consistent treatment of
initial and boundary conditions, of including the necessary physics,
and in interpreting observations.  The proposed project will model the
origin and evolution of galactic magnetic fields, and their impact on
the interstellar medium, from cosmological initial conditions to
the present day.  We will also create synthetic observations 
of synchrotron emission and dust polarization that will be invaluable for both future
CMB missions  and understanding existing measurements.
This work will
result in a deeper understanding of the evolution and morphology of magnetic
fields in galaxies.
This project is innovative due to its connection of
cosmological structure (i.e., galaxies and their environments) down to
molecular clouds and the star formation that occurs therein, and the
modeling of both of these classes of objects in a unified theoretical
and numerical framework.  
The understanding gained by doing this will
be transformative in terms of our ability to more accurately model
\red{star formation} through cosmic time, and will directly connect to
current and future observations of magnetic fields in a range of
astrophysical situations.
