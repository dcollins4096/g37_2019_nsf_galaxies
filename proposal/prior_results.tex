%% \noindent \textbf{Dr. Brian W. O'Shea:} is currently the PI or co-PI
%% of multiple NSF-funded projects.  The grant most relevant to this
%% project is an NSF Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Petascale
%% Computing Resource Allocation grant (PRAC; ACI 0832662; ``Formation of
%% the First Galaxies: predictions for the next generation of
%% observatories,'' PI: Brian O'Shea, \$40K, 5/2009-4/2013.
%% \textbf{Intellectual merit:} This grant examined high-redshift galaxy
%% formation using extremely sophisticated cosmological simulations that
%% included both radiation transport and detailed treatments of star
%% formation and feedback, and made detailed predictions about the
%% transition between metal-free and metal-enriched star formation as
%% well as the properties of populations of high redshift galaxies.
%% Publications from this grant include
%% \cite{2013ApJ...773...83X,2014ApJ...791..110X,2014ApJ...795..144C,2015MNRAS.452.2822S,
%% 2015ApJ...807L..12O, 2015ApJ...802....8A}, with additional papers
%% currently in the refereeing process.
%% \textbf{Broader Impacts:}  This project helped to improve the accuracy
%% of simulations of galaxy formation, which is crucial to making
%% predictions for a variety of ground- and space-based observational
%% campaigns.  It helped to train multiple graduate students and
%% postdoctoral researchers, and to make substantial infrastructure improvements  to the
%% \enzo\ and \yt\ codebases, which will benefit the user communities of
%% those tools.  Also, public talks relating to high redshift galaxies
%% and their importance to astronomy and astrophysics were given by
%% several of the investigators.


%\noindent \textbf{Dr. Brian W. O'Shea:} Dr. O'Shea has recently been
%the PI or co-PI of several NSF-funded projects.  The most relevant
%recent grant is an ongoing NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrsastructure
%Petascale Computing Resource Allocation grant (PRAC; ACI 1514580;
%``Petascale adaptive mesh simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies and
%their environments,'' \$31.5K, 8/1/2015-7/31/2018).  
%\textbf{Intellectual merits:} This
%project has created an extensive library of simulated
%Milky Way-like galaxies, their progenitors, and their environments,
%which can be used to explore a wide range of observable astrophysical
%phenomena.  The analysis of the simulations is ongoing, and are being
%used to interpret recent observations relating to the intergalactic
%and circumgalactic medium, galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields,
%and high redshift galaxy formation. The simulation data produced
%during the course of this project and resulting data products will be
%made publicly available, heavily leveraging this investment in
%computational resources.  \textbf{Broader impacts:} This project
%involves scientists in training at the undergraduate,
%graduate, and postdoctoral level.  Datasets have been visualized by
%the NCSA, and will be widely disseminated
%to the public.  Publications: \citep{Barrow17, Barrow17_FL2,
%2017ApJ...847...59H, 2016ApJ...833...84X, 2016ApJ...832L...5X}.
 
\textbf{Dr. David C. Collins:} Dr. Collins is PI on ``Magnetic Fields in the Formation of
Molecular Clouds, Filaments, and Cores'',  (NSF AST-1616026, \$298,492,
09/01/2016 - 08/31/2020)  which has been
examining collapse of pre-stellar cores and the role of magnetic fields therein.
We have focused on 1.) the initial conditions of pre-stellar core collapse 2.)
the energy budget of the collapse and rate-limiting processes and 3.) the work
done on the gas by magnetic forces.
\textbf{Intellectual merits:} This project is exploring the early phases of
pre-stellar cores with an aim to find the earliest precursors of star forming
objects.  \textbf{Broader impacts:} This project involves training graduate
students, and the data will be freely available upon the completion of the
project.  Publications are being prepared presently.

Dr. Collins was also Co-PI on 
an NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrsastructure
Petascale Computing Resource Allocation grant (PRAC; ACI 1514580;
``Petascale adaptive mesh simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies and
their environments,'' \$31.5K, 8/1/2015-7/31/2018)  \textbf{Intellectual
merits:} This project created an extensive library of simulated Milky Way-like
galaxies and their environments.  These will be used in the current proposal for
initial conditions of the cosmological simulations.  Publications: This has resulted in the publication of \citet{Chummels19}.
