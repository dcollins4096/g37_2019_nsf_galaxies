In this project, we will use high dynamic range magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations to understand how galactic-scale magnetic fields
affect the formation and evolution of molecular clouds, and to
identify the characteristics of these magnetized clouds that pertain
to star formation.  Specifically, we will use a targeted series of
high resolution MHD simulations of galaxy formation, both in a
cosmological context (Section~\ref{sec:cosmo_sims}) and as isolated, idealized
galaxies (Section~\ref{sec:molcloud_sims}), to explore the evolution
of magnetic fields through cosmic time.  

Each series of simulations will use
three main magnetic evolution assumptions: \emph{dynamo-only}  simulations,
wherein a weak seed field fills space at the beginning of the simulation, and
two \emph{feedback} recipes that vary the amount of field injected through
supernovae.  These \emph{feedback} recipes will use the toroidal injection
implemented in \enzo\ by \citet{Butsky17}.  This model deposits a fraction,
$\sigma$, of supernova energy in a toroidal configuration on the grid.  Our
large-field run will clone \citep{Butsky17} and use
 $10^{43}$erg per $\msun$ of initial
stellar mass, and our low-field run will use $1\%$ of that value.  For each of
the observational diagnostics,
(Section~\ref{sec:observational_comps}) we will perform synthetic observations,
matching noise and telescope resolution of the respective instruments, and
perform Baysian estimation to compare the four populations.  We expect that the
\emph{dynamo-only} simulations will fall short, which will allow us to bracket
the viability of our simulations.  In addition, we will perform the analysis on
the unfiltered simulations in the ``perfect telescope'' limit, which will allow
us to examine the ability of future SKA or Next Generation VLA observations to
explore these regions.

These calculations will be run with the \enzo\ code
(Section~\ref{sec:codes}) using computing time secured through the
XSEDE and PRAC allocation processes (Section~\ref{sec:comptime_sims}), and at all
times will be guided by, and compared to, a range of observations of
magnetic fields (Section~\ref{sec:observational_comps}).  This will be
done through close collaboration between an expert in simulations of
cosmological structure formation (O'Shea), an expert in simulations of
molecular clouds and star formation (Collins), an expert in
observations of cosmic magnetic fields from the local universe to
distant galaxies (Mao), a graduate
student, and a postdoctoral researcher (see Section~\ref{sec:timeline}).



% From the cosmological simulation

% \red{need to elaborate upon this a bit before we dive into the
